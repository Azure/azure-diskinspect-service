# Azure Disk Inspect Service
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/azure-diskinspect-service.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/azure-diskinspect-service)

The Azure Disk Inspect Service is intended to be a service that allows customers, support or third party personnel with privileged access to access an Azure OS Disk for log and configuration files without provisioning a VM and attaching a copy of the disk in order to probe the contents. It is a fast and secure way to retrieve well known contents of an OS disk by the user to aid in system failure diagnosis.


## Building (Local):

To build the docker container, ensure you have installed docker.io

	apt-get install docker.io
	
From the azure-diskinspect-service folder that was created after cloning, run the following script to build the docker container.

	./build.sh
	

## Building (Remote ACS):

You can also choose to directly build on an Azure Container Service by setting up Docker Port Forwarding. To do this you will need to copy the ssh private key for the Azure Container Service you created by adding the private key into: 

	~./id_rsa 
	
Ensure the id_rsa has sufficient permissions

	chmod 400 ~./id_rsa
	
Next, setup port forwarding,

	nohup ssh -L 2375:localhost:2375 -N user@host.com -p 2200 &
	
This will expose the port 2375 on your localhost to map to 2375 on the docker swarm. You can specify any port on the localhost that you desire if you intend to use multiple service mappings. 

Export the port forwarding rule for your local Docker instance to be communicate with the remote master.

	export DOCKER_HOST=:2375
	
To check if things went well, run:

	docker ps
	
to ensure that you are now connected to the remote docker swarm.

Follow the local build steps as documented before, but note that the docker container is now built on the remote machine.


## Deploying:

First ensure the SSL certificates for the NGINX server are available and placed at:

	~/azdis_ssl/

Assuming you have built the docker container, you can deploy it by running from your source folder:

	./scripts/run.sh
	
this sets up a server named "AzureDiskInspectService_US" by default.

Run:
	
	docker ps
	
to verify the service is up and running.

## Manual Testing:

Issue a curl query while logged into the docker container:

	docker exec -it AzureDiskInspectSvc_US bash
	<Docker Container> curl -k "https://127.0.0.1:8080/<OPERATION_ID>/<MODE>/<STORAGE BLOB NAME>/<CONTAINER BLOB NAME> -d "saskey=?<SAS QUERY PARAMETERS>

## Automated Testing

A set of automated tests can be run by executing the following logged into a VM which runs the container or within the container itself

	./tests/inspection_tests.py ~ "https://127.0.0.1:8080"

Automated testing is also through [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/).  Additional information on automated testing found [here](.docs/tests.md).

## Logs:

To look at real-time logs generated by the service, execute:

	./scripts/checklog.sh

To copy the logs over for examination on the host:

	./scripts/getlogs.sh
